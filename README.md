# Image-Processing-Tangible-Game
A tangible game that use image processing to detect the movements that you make with a plate in front of your camera to make the plate in the game move the same way!   
Done using Processing 3.


# How to launch
  - Install processing 3: https://processing.org   
  - Open the TangibleGame.pde file with processing 3 and execute it.  
  - Here for demonstration purposes the game is controlled by a video of someone moving a plate so you don't have to do it.
